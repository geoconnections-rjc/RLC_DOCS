#Load Estimator
**Use the Load Estimator to generate peak heating and cooling load approximations for budgetary use.**

###The Load Estimator is only available for single-zone projects. If the Load Estimator is activated, the ADD NEW ZONE feature will be locked.If the project already has more than one zone you will not be able to access the load estimator.

##Construction Details
Specify whether the home is constructed with 4" Exterior Walls, 6" Exterior Walls, or SIP (structurally insulated panels). 

**4-inch Exterior Walls:** This selection assumes the home was built using Southern construction methods (assumed use of R-11 wall insulation and R-21 ceiling insulation). 

**6-inch Exterior Walls:** This selection assumes the home was built using Northern construction methods (assumed use of R-19 wall insulation and R-30 ceiling insulation). 

**SIP Construction:** This selection assumes the home was built using new construction methods (assumed use of R-30 wall insulation and R-38 ceiling insulation
##House Tightness Levels
Specify the estimated level of air leakage (infiltration) into the home. 

**Loose:** This selection assumes above average infiltration levels (built pre-1970's, leaky windows, poor insulation, etc.). 

**Average:** This selection assumes average infiltration levels (built between 1970 and 1990, average windows, average insulation, etc.). 

**Tight:** This selection assumes below average infiltration levels (built post-1990's, good windows, good insulation, etc.). 
##Above Grade Conditioned Area
Specify the conditioned square footage for the home that is above ground level.

##Basement Details
Specify whether the home has a conditioned basement, an unconditioned basement, or if the house is slab on grade (no basement).

##Below Grade Conditioned Area
Specify the conditioned square footage for the home that is below ground level. This option will only be available if **Conditioned Basement** is selected in the **BASEMENT DETAILS** section.

##Ductwork Location
Specify whether the ductwork is located in conditioned space, in an unconditioned basement or cellar, or in an unconditioned attic.

##Deactivate Load Estimator
To deactivate the **Load Estimator** go to the **ZONE** page and click on the Delete Load Estimate button. 

###Estimated Loads are for BUDGETARY USE ONLY and are approximations not to be used for the design of a project.
